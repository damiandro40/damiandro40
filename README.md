## Hi there

I'm hobbyist web developer, working mostly on the back-end and from time to time I also do work on front-end (Vue / React). I'm still learning and improving my skills by making some projects that can be found here. I focus on creating APIs and real-time data-flow web apps. 

## Technologies
-Node  
-Vue & React  
-MongoDB  
-Redis  
-Google Cloud
